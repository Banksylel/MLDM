====================================================================================
keep all unzipped files in the same folder to avoid issues.

To run visualisation and exploration Notebooks:
1. Check that both the original datasets, both pre-processed datasets, and the exploration/visualisation .ipynb files are in the same location.
2. Run the exploration notebooks as you see fit. :)

To run a model Notebooks:
1. Check that all ipynb notebooks, datasets, and supporting files, are in the same location.
2. Run all of Final-PreProcessing.ipynb once to save a new preprocessed datasets. (pre processed datasets is also in the zip, if you do not want to run it)
3. Run the model .ipynb notebooks as you see fit.
(* Some Model Notebooks Have Custom Pre-Processing Built Into Them, But Should Not Be Affected By The Above Procedure*)
(* You Do Not Need To Re-Run The Pre-Processing After Each Model *)

To run the Relational Model Notebook:
1. Check that Relational Model.ipynb, Datasets-Convert2Relational-new.ipynb, and Supporting files are in the same location.
2. Run all of Datasets-Convert2Relational-new.ipynb notebook to convert the mushroom dataset into relational form as mushrooms.pl (mushrooms.pl is included in the zip, if you do not want to run it)
3. Change theory.txt to contain a queery you want the model to return. (is currently set to return all the rules of a poisonous mushroom)
4. Run the Relational Model.ipynb.
